# Movie Recommendation with Sentiment Analysis System
The "Movie Recommendation with Sentiment Analysis System" is an innovative project that combines the power of content-based movie recommendation with sentiment analysis of reviews. The system enhances the movie exploration process by analyzing reviews related to the selected movie. It employs a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to determine whether the reviews are positive or negative in nature. This sentiment analysis provides users with insights into the overall reception of the movie by the audience. The sentiment analysis aspect of the system leverages a pre-trained model from the GitHub repository *[Mukesh Mushyakhwo](https://github.com/MukeshMushyakhwo/Review-Sentiment-Analysis.)*. This integration enhances the accuracy and reliability of sentiment classification.

## Dataset
* Dataset was downoaded from kaggle *[TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata")*
